# Pixel-manipulation-for-image-encryption-and-decryption-in-python-pillow-library
This repository contains a simple image encryption and decryption tool using pixel manipulation techniques implemented in Python. The tool utilizes the Pillow and NumPy libraries to perform basic encryption by modifying pixel values. Users can encrypt an image by adding a constant value to each pixel and decrypt it by reversing the process.
